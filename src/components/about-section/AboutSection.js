          <p>I'm a front-end engineer living in Philadelphia, PA. I have nine years of professional experience with front-end engineering and development, but my personal interest in the field began with my first GeoCities fan page in 1997.</p>
          <p>Currently, I'm front-end engineer with Elsevier, a medical publishing company. I've been with Elsevier for seven years, and during that time, I've progressed from a junior- to senior-level role, contributing to each of the ClinicalKey applications: Physician, Nursing, Student, and most recently, CK Now.</p>
          <p>Before Elsevier, I worked with the University of Delaware as a Web developer. I focused on building interactive Web applications, but my role also included requirements gathering, QA, and some project management.</p>
          <p>I love development, but I like to round out my career with personal interests: watching movies, reading, learning photography, traveling, and experiencing Japanese food and language... and drinking whiskey ðŸ˜„.</p>
