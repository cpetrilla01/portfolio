            I'm a full-stack engineer living in Philadelphia, PA. I have over
            twelve years of professional experience with an emphasis on
            front-end development. Over my career, I've evolved into a
            full-stack JavaScript developer.

            Currently, I'm a full-time employee with Signant Health, building
            software that facilitates clinical trials. At Signant Health, I
            helped develop front-end standards of excellence to align multiple
            products under a greenfield project. I also heavily contributed to a
            company-wide React component library, which is currently used across
            these apps.

            Previously, I worked with Elsevier, a medical publishing company,
            for over eight years. During that time, I contributed to each of the
            ClinicalKey applications: Physician, Nursing, Student, and CK Now.
            Prior to Elsevier, I worked at the University of Delaware,
            contributing to their core web business systems.

            I love development, but I like to round out my career with personal
            interests: watching movies, reading, learning photography,
            traveling, exploring Japan when I'm able, and finding my next
            favorite coffee and whiskey ðŸ˜‰.
