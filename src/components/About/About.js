            I'm a front-end engineer living in Philadelphia, PA. I have over ten years of professional experience with front-end engineering, but my personal interest in the field began with my first GeoCities fan page in 1997.

            Currently, I'm a consultant with A2C, working with a healthcare company that facilitates clinical trials. My current focus is to establish a common paradigm across the various disparate applications that the company has acquired over the years. Going forward, I hope to learn more about micro services architecture (including micro front-ends) and help build a company-wide React-based component library.

            Previously, I worked with Elsevier, a medical publishing company, for over eight years. During that time, I contributed to each of the ClinicalKey applications: Physician, Nursing, Student, and CK Now. Prior to Elsevier, I worked at the University of Delaware, contributing to their core web business systems.

            I love development, but I like to round out my career with personal interests: watching movies, reading, learning photography, traveling, exploring Japan when I'm able, and finding my next favorite coffee... and whiskey ðŸ˜‰.
